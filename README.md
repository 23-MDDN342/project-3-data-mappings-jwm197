I have made the pupil width and height be on a single slider with 3 discrete options: one with a wide pupil, one with a tall pupil and one with a small circular pupil. I did this because there is no tracking data for the size of them and because people don't really get identified by the size of their pupil. The only thing that really gets seen is this person has a big pupil and this other one has a small one. Additionally I think it would have been quite hard to train the model when there were two sliders for width and height of it due to the size of the pupil not changing that noticably when the width or height were near its maximum and if they both are the eye just looks black. In the previous assignment when this just looked black I had it so the pupil would be scaled down if the width and height were both big but this would make it hard to identify people as the feature would not appear consistent and so make it harder to identify someone.

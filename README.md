I have trained the first half of the data. The parameters are as follows:

Side burn style: Square: long hair overlapping ear: triangle: short hair overlapping ear 
None if no hair . 

Sideburn height. The length of their hair as best matched as it can be to either the length of the hair on the face if either ear isn’t visible or to the top of the ear if visible and overlapping the approximate amount the hair overlaps the ear. 
Nose direction. Both if the face is looking straight on, left if the face is a profile shot of the left side of the face and right if it is a profile shot of the right side of the face. 
Pupil size: Represents the hair colour of black, brown, red, blonde or grey/bald.
Brown if set to “wide”, black if “small”, red if “tall”, blonde if “large” and grey or bald if “tiny”. 
 

Ear shape: None if neither ear is visible, Square if one ear is visible, circle if 2 ears are visible and triangle if they are wearing something in/on their ear (earrings, ear piece etc)  regardless of how many ears are shown.  
Inner ear y: The y position of the centre of the ear  
Has teeth: Boolean of whether the person has teeth showing or not in the photo
Number of teeth: The number of teeth they are showing. Only does anything if has teeth is true.   
Lip colour: red if masculine pink if feminine.

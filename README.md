I removed the sliders for the ear width and height as I mapped the width of them to the left eyebrow width and the height to the right eyebrow. Both of these have been mutliplied by a constant that makes the ear width smaller and the height larger to get the kind of shape I was after. I did this as noone can really recngise someone based off the size of their ear. I also made the mouth have the x position follow the tracking data as I felt it was werid when it didn't next to the nose that did. I also had to add a slight offset to the tip of the noses when sideways as there wasn't enough size to them as the points used mean that there is effectively have the nose being drawn.

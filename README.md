I retrained the data so there was 0 teeth on the same slider as number of teeth to try and copensate for the teeth being drawn when there are none. This makes the training data look really good for having teeth but it now means that the test data doesn't have many teeth which just looks bad. So I am going to revert this change even if it makes the training data slightly worse. This is what is called overfitting of the training data which makes the training data great but any test data not fit well.

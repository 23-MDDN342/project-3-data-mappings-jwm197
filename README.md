I have resized the eye so that it has its width mapped to the width of the facial data. I have made the height that of the eye is that of 2* the gap between the eye and eyebrow as using the the eyes height would have made the eye too small. The eyes look weird being different sizes. I am unsure what to do about this given technically it is due to the photo angles.

I trained a few but then it started to occur to me that the size of the ear wasn't working mapped to the eyebrows. As the size was deviating significantly from the person's ear at times. So I changed it so the ear was mapped to the nose's width and height. This probably wasn't the biggest deal as people don't recongise each other based on ears normally but it was throwing me off as there was a small fat ear drawn on someone with a long thin one which would make it harder to recongise them. The nose mapping to it isn't perfect either but gets much closer than the eyebrows at approximating the size to the extent it isn't noticable.
